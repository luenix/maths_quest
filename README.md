# maths_quest
A text based adventure based on solving maths problems.

Solve problems of increasing difficulty as you desend the levels of a dungeon. Decimals values are rounded to 2 decimal places. The game is pretty self explanitory.

This is my first upload to Github, and my first shared project, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.


Based on the game written by Bryan Hitchcock, see the original game here:
